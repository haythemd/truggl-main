    question: "What is the starting point for pricing in Truggl?",
    anwser: (
      <>
        Setting us apart from other video production agencies, we allocate the
        entire budget to create the best videos for our clients. That means no
        standing desks or expensive coffee machines‚Äîjust what you need to bring
        your vision to life, as demonstrated in the process above. <br />
        <br />
        Prices vary based on your project&apos;s scope, but our pricing starts
        from $1000 and can go up to $8000.
        <br />
        <br /> The more you invest, the more talents and assets we can involve
        from our team to enhance the speed and professionalism of the process.

    question: "How much time does a 60-second video take?",
    anwser: (
      <>
        It depends on the complexity of the video overall, but you could expect
        a premium video in 5-6 weeks. <br /> <br /> If you need more than one
        video, we can manage multiple projects at the same time.
        <br /> <br /> Even if you&apos;re in a rush, we could help you by
        finishing it faster for an additional fee.

    question: "How is the revision policy?",
    anwser: (
      <>
        Our primary goal is to exceed your expectations.
        <br />
        <br /> During the pre-production stage (script & storyboard), we provide
        unlimited revisions, ensuring they are reasonable and in line with the
        project&apos;s vision. Additionally, we offer 2 revisions at the
        project&apos;s conclusion if you didn&apos;t like a scene or 2.
        <br />
        <br /> If you require more revisions, there may be a slight additional
        cost, but rest assured, we&apos;ll work closely with you to accommodate
        your needs. For further clarification,
        <br /> our account manager is available to discuss details during a call
        ü§ù.

    question: "What if I'm Not Satisfied with the Work?",
    anwser: (
      <>
        It&apos;s very unlikely to be dissatisfied with the work, as long as we
        adhere to the established agreement. We can make as many revisions as
        you want within the agreed-upon terms. In the rare case that you&apos;re
        not satisfied with the results, we will continue to make adjustments
        until you are pleased.
        <br />
        <br /> While this hasn&apos;t occurred for us before, it&apos;s just a
        precautionary note.
        <br />
        <br /> We can offer a refund, but not for finished work (projects
        already completed). However, if you need a refund for any other reason,
        we offer a refund of 60% of the total amount. It&apos;s important to
        note that nothing from the final results of the project will be
        delivered.
        <br />
        <br /> Everything will be explained and aligned in a contract
        beforehand.{" "}

    question: "How does a VSL help with finding clients",
    anwser: (
      <>
        Imagine yourself, but not working in your current company. Would you
        have the same emotional investment in your product or services? Do you
        know why you need it and how it works?
        <br />
        <br /> Now, consider that&apos;s 99.9999‚Ä¶% of humanity. Would they be
        interested in buying if they don&apos;t have emotional investment in
        your product or service?
        <br />
        <br />
        That&apos;s our problem. As founders, we assume that it&apos;s too
        obvious or everything is clear because we&apos;ve been working for years
        in our business. However, other people will not be as interested as we
        are. So, we have to explain to them, and that&apos;s where a good sales
        video should be used.{" "}
